# Changes

####1.7.1 - 2015-09-27
* Removed support for deprecated AdMob location set by string (you should use lon/lat coordinates instead)
* `supportedInterfaceOrientations` return type changed to `UIInterfaceOrientationMask`
* Demo project updated to use Storyboards as it seems to be the most common thing to do

####1.7 - 2015-02-06
* Updated to work with the new AdMob framework (7.0.0) which is now the minimum required.
* Dropped support for iOS 5 as a result of the above requirement (stick with v1.6.3 if you still need this)
* Method for AdMob targeting based on age has changed, if you use this you will need to provide an NSDate object now.
* AdMob framework no longer requires you to add the `-ObjC` linker flag to your project settings. And depending on your project setup you may not need to manually link all the required frameworks either.
* Updated demo project to fix iOS 8 issues and generally modernise it, should now work properly when testing on any device type.

####1.6.3 - 2015-02-05
* Just a minor change to the podspec file. AdMob starting at version 7.0.0 is now distributed as a framework. The current podspec for CJPAdController now explicitly states to use the v6.12.2 library. This will be needed for the class to work as it is, and will also be needed for anyone still wanting to support iOS 5 in their apps. CJPAdController v1.7 will be modified to use the new AdMob framework.
* **This is the last release of CJPAdController to support iOS 5.x**

####1.6.2 - 2015-01-16
* Fixed bug where if a long initialDelay time was given, a user may have the opportunity to remove ads before the delay has passed, resulting in an ad being show after the delay passes when it shouldn't be. (Thanks @pawelkata - [#21](https://github.com/chrisjp/CJPAdController/issues/21))
* Added a property to override `isNavController`. If you use a custom view controller that isn't a subclass of UINavigationController or UITabBarController you may need to set this to YES to ensure CJPAdController behaves correctly in your implementation. ([#20](https://github.com/chrisjp/CJPAdController/issues/20))

####1.6.1 - 2014-09-28
* Now thread safe. (Thanks @numen31337 - [#17](https://github.com/chrisjp/CJPAdController/pull/17))
* Support for AdMob Targeting. You can now (optionally) choose to target AdMob ads based on your users' gender, age, and location. Please read the comments in the header file before using any of these.
* Delegate methods for the view controller's `supportedInterfaceOrientations` and `preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation`, the former of which had accidentally been removed in a previous commit.
* Limited support for use within custom view controllers used by OpenGL games. (Thanks @pyrosphere - [#16](https://github.com/chrisjp/CJPAdController/pull/16))

####1.6 - 2014-07-13
* Rewrote the class such that you can now configure CJPAdController via your app delegate, this means you no longer have to edit the header file which should make upgrading to future versions and using CocoaPods much smoother.
* Now respects `supportedInterfaceOrientations` if you've overridden this method in your view controllers.
* Speculative fix for a rare case whereby the ad controller may have tried to remove an ad from view while a user was viewing it.

####1.5.2 - 2014-03-13
* Fixed all Xcode warnings about methods deprecated since iOS 6. Achieved by using the newer iAd sizing methods introduced in iOS 6. The older iOS 5 methods have been kept in conditionally and will only be used if you target < iOS 6.
* Fixed a rare UI bug that could occur on iPads if you were displaying ads at the top of your views and a certain chain of events happened. Could cause a 24px gap after an AdMob ad was replaced with an iAd.
* In the header file you can now specify a comma-separated string of device ID's that should receive test ads for AdMob, so you no longer need to edit the .m file to add these.

####1.5.1 - 2014-03-12
* Fixed `shouldAutorotate`, `prefersStatusBarHidden` and `preferredStatusBarStyle` methods not being respected when set in your view controllers. This should reduce the need to modify CJPAdController.m to fix possible rotation and/or status bar issues you may have had.
* Cleaned up some AdMob code to remove need for GADAdMobExtras.h import.

####1.5 - 2013-10-05
* Fixed ads appearing behind status bar in iOS 7. ([#9](https://github.com/chrisjp/CJPAdController/issues/9))
* Improved iOS 7 support in general (regarding status bar preferences).
* Added support for specifying AdMob ads as "child-directed", for COPPA compliance (see [AdMob docs](https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/admob/additional-controls#ios-coppa) for more info).
* Removed support for iOS 4 due to lack of time and ability to test.

####1.4.3 - 2013-05-18
* Fix bug introduced in 1.4.2 where ads may be untappable when using a UITabBarController.

####1.4.2 - 2013-05-17
* Fix for ads sliding up over TabBar (now slide up from underneath it).

####1.4.1 - 2013-05-16
* Better support for use within apps using a UITabBarController - ads positioned at "bottom" can now be set to appear above or below the TabBar.
 * A very basic TabBar example is included in the demo app (change the `useTabBar` BOOL to YES in AppDelegate.m to see it in action).

####1.4 - 2013-04-07
* Updated bundled AdMob library to 6.3.0.
* iOS 4.3 is now the minimum supported version of iOS. This is due to Apple dropping support for the armv6 architecture.
* Removed deprecated code that was needed for iOS 4.0/4.1.
* Added a method to enable you to restore ads to your view after removing them.
* Updated the demo project to reflect the updated behaviour in removing and restoring ads, also added iPhone 5 support.

####1.3 - 2012-09-12
* Fixed iOS 4 compatibility. Now works on iOS 4.0+ (was 4.2+ before).

####1.2 - 2012-09-05
* Completely rewrote class - now shares a single instance of ADBannerView's across views, as recommended by Apple.
* Now a subclass of UIViewController - resizing ads when rotating is now done automatically.
* Added the ability to choose where ads are displayed within a view (top or bottom)
* Added a method that can be called to remove ads permanently, for example if your user buys an in-app purchase to remove them.

####1.1 - 2012-08-10
* Fixed a couple of issues in iOS 6
* Replaced #define's with const's
* Updated bundled AdMob SDK to version 6.1.4 and replaced some deprecated code
* Added a configuration option (boolean) to specify whether to use AdMob "[Smart Banners](https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/admob/smart-banners)" or not.
* Updated this readme with information on configuring.

####1.0 - 2012-04-07
* Initial release
